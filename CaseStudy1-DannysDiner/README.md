## üõ†Ô∏è Bussiness Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

## Dataset

1. **Table 1: sales**
  * The sales table captures all customer_id level purchases with a corresponding order_date and product_id information for when and what menu items were ordered.

2. **Table 2: menu**
  * The menu table maps the product_id to the actual product_name and price of each menu item.

3. **Table 3: members**
  * The final members table captures the join_date when a customer_id joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

Here is the [link](https://github.com/poojarao76/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%231%3A%20Danny's%20Diner/database.sql) for the Schema for the dataset.

    ```
    WITH afterMemb AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, mm.join_date,

    FROM sales s
    JOIN members mm
    ON s.customer_id=mm.customer_id
    JOIN menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id

7. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

    ```
    SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_item, SUM(m.price) AS total_spend
    FROM sales s

8. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

    ```
    SELECT s.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
    WHEN m.product_name='sushi' THEN m.price*20

9. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

    ```
    WITH programDates AS(

10. Join All The Things - Create a table that has these columns: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N).

    ```
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price, 
    CASE WHEN s.order_date>=mm.join_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N' END AS membr
    FROM sales s
    JOIN menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    LEFT JOIN members mm
    ON s.customer_id=mm.customer_id
    ```

    ![alt text](../assets/cs1/image-8.png)


11.  Rank All The Things - Based on the table above, add one column: ranking.

    ```
    WITH customersData AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price, 
    CASE WHEN s.order_date>=mm.join_date THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N' END AS membr
    FROM sales s
    JOIN menu m
    ON s.product_id=m.product_id
    LEFT JOIN members mm
    ON s.customer_id=mm.customer_id
    )
    SELECT *, 
    CASE WHEN membr = 'Y'
    THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, membr ORDER BY order_date)
    END AS ranking
    FROM customersData;
    ```
